# An Intelligent Optimized Multimodal Learning Framework for Early Prediction of Lung Cancer Recurrence

## Project Overview

An Intelligent Optimized Multimodal Learning Framework for Early Prediction of Lung Cancer Recurrence is an AI-driven healthcare project aimed at predicting lung cancer recurrence by integrating **clinical data** and **CT scan images**. The project leverages both **machine learning** and **deep learning** models to improve prediction accuracy and support early clinical decision-making.

This project is designed as a **Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) major project** and focuses on building an end-to-end, research-oriented, real-world medical AI system.

## Objectives

* Predict the likelihood of lung cancer recurrence at an early stage
* Fuse heterogeneous data sources (clinical + imaging)
* Improve prediction performance over unimodal approaches
* Provide an interpretable and deployable AI solution for healthcare

---

## System Architecture

The system follows a **multimodal fusion pipeline**:

1. **Clinical Data Processing**

   * Data cleaning and preprocessing
   * Feature engineering and normalization
   * Model: XGBoost 

2. **Image Data Processing**

   * CT scan preprocessing
   * Feature extraction using CNN (VGG16)
   * Deep feature representation

3. **Multimodal Fusion**

   * Fusion of clinical and imaging features
   * Optimized feature combination strategy using Late fusion

4. **Prediction Layer**

   * Final recurrence prediction (Yes / No)

5. **Web Interface (Optional Deployment)**

   * Streamlit-based UI for prediction
